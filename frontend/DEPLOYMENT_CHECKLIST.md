## Pre-Deployment Testing

### Local Testing
- [ ] Clear browser localStorage
- [ ] Sign in with Google
- [ ] Verify console shows ‚úÖ logs
- [ ] Check localStorage has 'token' and 'user'
- [ ] Verify user._id is present
- [ ] Add items to cart
- [ ] Place order - should NOT show "User ID not found"
- [ ] Check Orders page loads
- [ ] Refresh page - user should still be logged in
- [ ] Sign out - verify localStorage cleared

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Backend /api/user/firebase-login returns user object
- [ ] Backend /api/order/place accepts userId
- [ ] Backend /api/order/userorders returns orders
- [ ] Token validation working on protected routes

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Code
```bash
# Create backup of current frontend
git checkout -b backup-before-auth-fix
git push origin backup-before-auth-fix
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy to staging server
# Verify all features work
# Monitor error logs
```

### Step 3: Smoke Tests on Staging
- [ ] Login with Google
- [ ] Add to cart
- [ ] Place order
- [ ] View orders
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Check error logs for anomalies

### Step 4: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy frontend code
# Monitor error rates
# Check user logs
```

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Orders can be placed
- [ ] No increase in error rate
- [ ] No user complaints
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

```bash
# If issues occur, rollback to previous version
git revert <commit-hash>
npm run build
# Redeploy previous version
```

**Note:** All changes are backward compatible, so rollback should be seamless.
